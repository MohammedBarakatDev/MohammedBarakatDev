ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mohammed Barakat!
  Iâ€™m passionate about web development and specialize in the MERN stack.
  As an information technology engineering student, 
  Iâ€™m also diving into the fascinating world of AI and deep learning. 
  When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me exploring beautiful color palettes and creating delightful UI/UX designs.
